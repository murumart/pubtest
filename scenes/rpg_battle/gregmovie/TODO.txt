how to make

imagined gameplay "flow":
	* click on him
	* select action
		- some are like "move here"
			. this should have mouse highlight a tile and await for a click
			. and then return a move action result toward that
		- others are like "attack region"
			. highlight region under mouse and hide menu?
			. need to keep in mind maximum range perhaps
			. await for click again and apply
	* what's in the action menu?
		- move
		- attack tile
	* move forward in the menu with left clicks, backward with right clicks
	* after action completed, other actors can act
		- need to stuff awaits there so its humanly visible time
			. damn
